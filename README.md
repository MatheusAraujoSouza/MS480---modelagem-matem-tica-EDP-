MS480 Mathematical Modeling: Exploring Effects of Boundary Condition Variations on PDEs

The design of MS480, a course on mathematical modeling, delves into the impact of boundary condition variations on Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).

To comprehend and analyze the behavior of a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) under different left boundary conditions, a series of tests and simulations were conducted. These experiments focused on specific conditions, such as a ramp function, which revealed intriguing observations. Notably, certain variations in time and height led to a significant increase in the maximum value of the function on the left side. As a consequence, our curve exhibited a notable upward shift, deviating from the expected behavior of the sin(xt) function observed prior to the alteration of boundary conditions. This deviation underscores the dynamic nature of PDEs and the intricate relationship between boundary conditions and their effects on the system's behavior.
